# To-do-list
"We are a team of students from the Egyptian Chinese University.
Using a to-do list helps us every day to organize our assignments, manage our time, and study more effectively.
We found it to be a very practical tool, so we decided to create our own to-do list designed especially for Egyptian Chinese University students, to help them stay organized and reduce stress throughout the semester."
